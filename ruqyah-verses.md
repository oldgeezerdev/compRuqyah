The core content section contains a comprehensive collection of verses covering various aspects of Islamic protection, healing, and spiritual strength, including the essential chapters for Ruqyah practice.

## Targeted Section: Healing & Protection

**For Protection & Healing - The "Spiritual Shield" Verses**

**Rationale:** These verses focus on affirming Tawhid (Allah's Oneness), seeking refuge, and establishing Allah's authority over creation, particularly over the jinn and evil forces.

**Surah Al-Isra (17:45-47):** These verses describe how Allah places a barrier between the Prophet (ﷺ) and those who deny the truth, protecting him from their evil. This is invoked as a protective veil.

**Surah As-Saffat (37:1-10):** These verses explicitly mention that the heavens are guarded against devils by shooting stars. They are recited to seek similar divine guardianship.

**Surah Fussilat (41:30-36):** A powerful promise that angels descend upon those who affirm "Our Lord is Allah" and then remain steadfast, offering them reassurance and protection.

**Surah Ar-Rahman (55:33-36) & Surah Al-Jinn (72:1-9):** These directly address the jinn, challenging their power and highlighting their limitations, thereby establishing spiritual authority over them.

**Spiritual Principle:** These verses work by strengthening the believer's spiritual defenses through affirmation of faith and seeking Allah's guardianship.

1. Surah Al-Isrā' (17:45-47) - Protection through Quranic recitation (combined verses)
2. Surah Al-Isrā' (17:82) - The Quran as healing and mercy for believers
3. Surah Al-Mu'minūn (23:115-118) - About Allah's purpose in creation (combined verses)
4. Surah Al-Ṣaffāt (37:1-10) - The ranks of angels and protection from devils (combined verses)
5. Surah Fuṣṣilat (41:30-36) - Angels descending upon the righteous (combined verses)
6. Surah Ar-Raḥmān (55:33-36) - Challenge to jinn and mankind (combined verses)
7. Surah Al-Jinn (72:1-9) - The jinn's testimony about the Quran (combined verses)

## Targeted Section: Shifa – General Shifā' (Healing & Relief)

**For General Shifa (Healing & Relief) - The "Explicit Cure" Verses**

**Rationale:** This category is the most straightforward. It consists of verses that explicitly contain the word "شفاء" (Shifa - cure/healing) or are direct supplications for healing from the Prophets.

**Surah At-Tawbah (9:14), Surah Yunus (10:57), Surah An-Nahl (16:69), Surah Al-Isra (17:82), Surah Fussilat (41:44):** All these verses explicitly state that Allah sends down/has made the Qur'an a "شفاء" (healing) for people. When you recite them, you are essentially reminding Allah of His own promise and asking Him to fulfill it for the patient.

**Surah Ash-Shu'ara (26:80):** This is the du'a of Prophet Ibrahim (AS): "And when I am ill, it is He who cures me." Reciting this is to seek healing by following the example of the Prophets in turning to Allah during illness.

**Spiritual Principle:** These verses work on the principle of "reminding Allah of His promise" (Tadhkir) and seeking healing through the explicit attributes of the Qur'an.

1. Surah At-Tawbah (9:14) - Allah healing the hearts of believers
2. Surah Al-Naḥl (16:69) - Honey containing healing for people
3. Surah Al-Isrā' (17:82) - The Quran as healing and mercy for believers
4. Surah Al-Shu'arā (26:80) - Prophet Ibrahim's statement about Allah as the Healer
5. Surah Al-Fuṣṣilat (41:44) - The Quran as guidance and healing

## Targeted Section: For Sihr (Magic)

1. Surah Al-Baqarah (2:102) - About magic and sorcery during Solomon's reign
2. Surah Al-A'raf (7:117-122) - Moses vs. Pharaoh's magicians
3. Surah Yunus (10:81-82) - Moses declaring magic will be exposed
4. Surah Taha (20:69) - Moses' staff swallowing the magicians' tricks
